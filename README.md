# Pleiotropic correction  
Pleiotropic genes are genes that influence multiple, seemingly unrelated biological processes or traits. In gene regulatory networks, this means a single transcription factor (TF) may appear to regulate a broad and diverse set of genes, not necessarily because it is biologically driving them, but due to statistical or network artifacts. In the context of VIPER and pyVIPER, this can lead to inflated activity scores for such transcription factors, especially when they share many targets with more specific regulators. To address this, the original VIPER implementation in R included a pleiotropy correction step (via the shadowRegulon function) to penalize TFs that may be masking others due to shared targets. This correction helps ensure that protein activity inference reflects true regulatory influence rather than pleiotropic noise. The same logic has now been implemented in pyVIPER to enhance its biological accuracy and replicate the robustness of the original R version. 

These files contain the results of an analysis performed both with and without pleiotropy correction, as well as the original R implementation of the pleiotropy correction transcribed into Python as a function named shadowRegulon_py.
